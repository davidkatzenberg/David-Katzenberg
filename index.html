<!--Hello, maker! Welcome to my Electrate Fuego web design tutorial. I'm glad you found it – for this might be a real intersection on your way to becoming. I (S.J. Quigley) use this document in my Technical Communications classes at the University of Pittsburgh to teach my students a little bit about computer science and something called "electracy." Just follow along with comments like this one, and you'll make a really cool web documemt that not only introduces you to the other people in our classes, but will help you process how different discourse communities in your life have contributed to your arrival in this space, virtual and actual, and also contribute to where you might be going. 

In this doc, you will work through Gregory Ulmer's discourses of career, family, entertainment, community, and schooling (_Internet Invention From Literacy to Electracy_, 2002.) In Ulmer's text, he elides community and schooling into one category, but for our puposes I have separated them. Ulmer's theory of electracy helps makes sense of how we find/construct meaning and connect with others rhetorically in a media rich ecology. Ulmer uses analogy to define electracy, explaining that "electracy is to digital media what literacy is to print." 

You could make this document the easy way--like I once did by using a program called Adobe Spark: https://spark.adobe.com/page/umUY5ROHgANCl/, or you can do a little more work to unconceal, opening up these tools that you use every day, but might not know how they function, yet prove so necessary to how you (re)present yourself and connect with others in virtual spaces. And this last bit is an important point! If we really want to be makers, if we really want to be creative, then we need to understand what our digital tools do, how they work, and consider the implications of their use. Through this process you will alos learn a little bit about computer literacy and computer science. Enough to allow you to build web texts and understand file management. 

So let's cut this thing open – using "tmesis" as the Ancient Greeks would call it – lets "cut" and arrange, tweak, take away and augment...that's how we create! I hope you're excited to use this tool to create a document that will simultaneously help you process your journey and help orient you along the path on which you are headed in your becoming. Before we get going I would like to give a shout-out to my research buddy Shauna Chung, who helped me develop the original Ulmerian framework we will be following in this document. Are you ready to get started?--> 
    
 <!--To get started, you will need to fork my repository from GitHub if you haven't already. If you want to easily publish it on GitHub, I'll give you more information at the end of this document. But for right now, fork, and then download the website to a zip file (or clone it, if you know what that means). Go ahead and put these files in a secure place (folder) where you will be able to find them and organize your other assests like images, pdfs, etcetera. You will also need a text editor like "brackets.io" or "atom.io" or "notepad-plus-plus.org." Open the style.css and index.html documents in the text editor and we can get started building our own electrate experience.--> 

<!--BTW. You can leave these hidden HTML text fields be, or delete them. They are but road signs, absent from the larger design-->

<!--First we will need to do some work in the head of the document. The head organizes important information needed to expalin to browsers how the website will work. Go ahead and change the title of this HTML document below, from "Electrate Fuego" to whatever you want it to be called. Your new text will appear in your browser tab-->
    
<title>David Katzenberg</title>
    
    <!--this next section of code does important work to help different browsers understand what this page should look like on the different kinds of screens.-->

<!--The body of the document houses the content that a user usually sees on a website. We'll be spending most of our time in this section.-->
    
<body>
       
<!-- We'll need to do some more work in this section, but to do so, we'll need to make some changes on your style.css file. Developers refer to this division as a "Hero Block," but we will refer to it as a "Wide Image."  Think carefully about the image you select and how it might serve a sybolic function in your life. Ulmer refers to these kinds of symbolic images as "wide images" in that they often repeat over and over in our lifetime. We will similarly repeat this image at the end of your Electrate Infuego composition to establish a motif in this web document.  

Place a .jpg or .png in the same file folder as this project (hint: simplify the name). You don't need to do anything on this html page, but you'll need to change the background image name on the style.css page to match you image asset.

Now, change the other relevant information in this section, especially if you're not John en Fuego or not majoring in "electracy"-->

      <!--In our first exploration of discourse, we're going to think about the wider characteristics or themes of our field or future career. In academia, we do a lot of work narrowing our interest to arrive at a career or profession, often reducing our field to a level of operation or an act. Instead, I would like you to think more broadly about the "wider themes" you associate with your field or future career and its larger significance in improving our world. Yes--improving the world. Thinking back, where do you see exposure to those same "wider themes" in your own life? Those ah-ha moments, lessons, examples, tools, passions, or qualities that suggested this career path to you?

  <h1>Sustainable Civil Engineering</h1>
    
  <h2>Civil Engineering work deals with maintaining and designing the foundations and general infrastructure of society. Whether it's the bridge you drive your car over on to the way to work or the water you drink, chances are a Civil Engineer had something to do with the physical design of that system or process. My current career aspirations are to take my Civil Engineering degree and put a sustainable and entrepreneurial twist on it. One day I hope to open a start up business focussed on solving environmental issues through the lense of Civil Engineering. For example, CO2 emissions are largely attributed to longstanding systems and processes such as transportation, energy production, and pollution, so from my perspective it makes sense to work towards improving these systems with the hope of improving our environmental situation. The main driving forces behind my career path choices have been my mom and my high school AP Environmental Science teacher. My mom used to work for Clean Water Action, a nonprofit which advocates for water quality and standards, which instilled in me an understanding of the environment's importance to society from a young age. My AP Enviro teacher helped further direct me towards envrionmental issues by passionately and clearly depicting current sustainability problems and their undervalued importance to society during class. I hope that one day I will use my degree to help people by solving environmental issues in the Civil Engineering field.</h2>

This might sound weird, but Ulmer argues that media has actually contributed a great deal to who you are as a person, how you language yourself, and even how you move through the world and interact with others. So, let's take some time to explore this discourse area. You have the opportunity to add video content or other significant media content. You might also add images to this section (see the bottom of this sheet for directions on how to add elements) perhaps adding a photo grid like the one you did for the "Family" section. Experiment.

  <h2>If I had to sumarize my media consumption into the most general phrase possible, it would be "sports and math". Sometimes, separate, but most of the time together. I have played soccer, baseball, basketball, and tennis since I was 3 and have never lost interest in the sporting world. Additionally, in school I tended to gravitate towards math and science rather than english and history. As a result, most of my media consumption is sport related and generally the sports content is looked at from a statistical/analytical standpoint. My most watched youtube channels and podcasts deal with statistical analysis of soccer and how executives and coaches sometimes overlook statistics which cause them to make poor decisions. The linked youtube video is from one of my favorite media producers John Bois. John's videos have a unique feeling to them and are more of an experience than a viewing. John tells compelling stories from his own perspective and more often than not incorporates some sort of interesting statistical narrative that you don't need to like math to enjoy. I hope that by sharing this with you, some of you will discover this series and appreciate it. Now that I am writing this, I see now that consuming mass analytical media subconsciously played a big part in choosing engineering.</h2>

I'll let you explain. -->
    
    <div class="par-centertext">
  <h2>Community for me is mutiple things. For one, it's my home town and my friends from high school who I played soccer/baseball with and have known since I was a kid. On the other hand, my pitt community is completely different and is composed of engineering and premed students instead of athletes and lifelong friends. Then there is the Jewish community from my camp who I bonded with over the summers of 2018 and 2019. I could continue, but the best conclusion I can give is that I have yet to find my primary community. In high school I felt the same way and honestly I have not been part of a group of people who I completely connect with yet, so I hope that in the near future I can discover my primary community.</h2>

  <h2>I attended Cheltenham High School in the suburbs of Philadelphia. Cheltenham, despite the adminstrative failures, was an amazing and unique high school experience. Cheltenham is an incredibly diverse school which offers a lot of AP classes. However, it also has issues with education gaps and discipline. Going to Cheltenham gave me an invaluable education both in academics and diversity which helped make me both a better student and a more open minded person. If I had the choice, I honestly would not have had it any other way. I found a good group of friends through high school and had multiple influential teachers that engaged me in education. Cheltenham made the transition to college unusual because unlike most students, I was moving into a less diverse environment rather than a more diverse one. It has been this decrease in diversity that has made me unwary at times here at Pitt and has made it hard for me to understand the experiences of my friends who came from less diverse areas. Nevertheless, Pitt has been a positive experience so far. Joining the engineering school helped me connect to people who think the same way I do which helped me better adjust to college. I came in as an undecided engineering major, but I honestly did not even know if I wanted to do engineering at all. The engineering program at Pitt helped to show me how I could reach my goals of solving environmental issues through engineering. If I had to choose a few big learning takeaways from my college experience so far it would be: improved work ethic, more consistent confidence, analytical problem solving, and a clearer career plan. I hope to use these takeaways to further my engineering career and help improve the lives of others. </h2>
